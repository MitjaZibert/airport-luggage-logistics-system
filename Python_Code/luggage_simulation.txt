DB Data:
=======================================================================

-- from airport: DFW (858), MAD (593), ORD (539), LHR (443)
-- to airport: DFW (838), MAD (577), ORD (535), LHR (456)


=======================================================================
SIMULATION STEPS:
=======================================================================

1. Generate all flights for one week, with all the luggage and passengers
    - incoming flights carry luggage of three types (1. is final destination, 2. to connecting flight, 3. returning delayed luggage)
    - departing flights carry luggage of three types (1. checked in luggage, 2. from connecting flight, 3. forwarding delayed luggage-this is done in step two on DB)

2. Simulate each hour in a day
    - simulate all flights delays for that hour (update flights table)
    - trigger db procedure to process all the luggage in the system (for that hour)
        - to connecting flight (+ luggage that missed previous flight)
        - to Baggage Claim Area
        - Unclaimed Baggage Department (if returned)
    - simulate status of each luggage
        - missed connecting flight (goes to Baggage Service Office until next flight)
        - not claimed (+ check for luggage from up to past 3 hours) (goes or remains in Unclaimed Baggage Department)
        

3. (trigger on DB) Each end of day check if luggage needs to be transfered to a different department


- Simulate one week, each day seperately, each hour seperately (1 hour = 1 sec)
    - Each hour get all arriving flights and all departing flights
        - Each flight produces a simulated* amount of luggage that is stored in a luggage table
            - incoming flights carry luggage of three types (1. is final destination, to connecting flight, returning luggage)
            - departing flights carry luggage of three types (1. checked in luggage, from connecting flight, returning luggage)
            - 
- Store all flights for a week (arriving, departing)
- Store all luggage for each flight
- Each hour (1 second) of simulation calls a DB procedure to process flights and luggage for that hour
- Each end of day check if luggage needs to be transfered to a different department - db trigger based on flight hour

* simulated luggage
- determine luggage for each flight (number of pieces, cabin class, destination, owner**, )
- randomize luggage misshandeling
- 

** if passanger is traveling on a connected flight count him and luggage for the connecting flight as well

1. Check-In Process - handeled by baggage handling system
    a. (99.2%) Successful load - Loaded to the right flight
    b. (0.3%) Late Check-In --> Rebooked For The Next Flight
    c. (0.5%) Unsuccessful load - Loaded to the wrong flight - Rebooked For The Next Flight Back (go to point 2)
   
2. Flight transit
    
3. Arrival at airport
    a. Sent to Baggage Claim Area - handeled by baggage handling system
        a. (99.9%) Picked Up by a passenger
        b. (0.1%) Not picked up - after 3 hours remmoved and stored at Baggage Service Office
            a. (90%) Claimed by a passenger within 7 days
            b. (10%) Not claimed for 7 days --> moved to Unclaimed Baggage Department 
                a. (95%) Claimed by a passenger within 60 days
                b. (5%) Not claimed for 83 days --> Disposed Luggage Area
    b. If connecting flight sent to next flight - handeled by baggage handling system
        a. (99.2%) Successful load - Loaded to the right flight
        b. (0.5%) Missed connecting flight due to delay - Rebooked For The Next Flight
        c. (0.3%) Unsuccessful load - Loaded to the wrong flight - Rebooked For The Next Flight Back (go to point 2)

4. (cca 2 / hour) Found at airport or aircraft
    Sent to Lost & Found Department
        a. Claimed by a passenger within 30 days
        b. Not claimed for 30 days --> moved to Unclaimed Baggage Department 
            a. Claimed by a passenger within 60 days
            b. Not claimed for 90 days --> disposed

Possible luggage problems
=======================================================================

1. Check-In
- Incorrect tagging (e.g., wrong destination or flight).
- Late check-in, which may not allow enough time for the bag to be loaded onto the plane.

2. Baggage Handling and Sorting
- Bags may be misrouted due to scanner errors or human mistakes.
- Mishandling during sorting can lead to damage or delays

3. Loading onto the Aircraft
- Tight connection times between flights can result in bags being left behind.
- Weather delays or operational issues may disrupt the loading process.

4. Transit (Connecting Flights)
- Short layover times increase the risk of bags missing the connecting flight.
- Bags may be sent to the wrong connecting flight, especially if multiple flights are departing to similar destinations

5. Arrival and Claim
- Bags may be delayed if they are unloaded last or if there are issues with the baggage claim system.
- Theft or accidental pickup by another passenger can occur at the baggage claim area.

============================================================================

Statistics on Lost Luggage
- Delayed Bags: Around 85% of "lost" luggage is simply delayed and is usually returned to the passenger within a few days 
- Permanently Lost Bags: Only about 3% of luggage is permanently lost or stolen 
- Recovery Rate: Approximately 97% of lost luggage is eventually returned to its owner 


=======================================================================
Flight Delays
=======================================================================
- Average number of delayed flights per day: 25%
- Average delays:
    - Minor Delays  (15-59 minutes): ~80% of all delays.
    - Severe Delays (60+ minutes): ~20% of all delays.
